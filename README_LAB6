THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 6 
BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL
OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE
MYSELF WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE
INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.

My name is Ben Elleman, and this lab took me about 4 hours. Normally I'd say that this lab was too short, but I've
felt pretty burned out and ready for the semester to wrap up, so I'd say this was a very good lab. This felt just
like the previous lab except with the one gimmick of now having weird lea sizes, but we've only been going over things
like padding or seqential memory arrays for the past 2 weeks or so, so I'd call that more of an inditement of the
class than of the lab.
